<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>I am an avid musician; I enjoy playing guitar, drums, bass, writing music and performing with friends at pubs.
  When I was young I performed on drums at the Royal Northern College of Music, Manchester for Chorley Silver Brass Band.
  I studied Music Technology at college where I learned music theory to a grade 4 level, and also learned many skills for the recording and production of music,
  which I still use in my spare time for making my own music. </p>
<p>I also enjoy outdoor activities and sports such as mountain-biking, walking, tennis and camping as well as indoor ones such as video games and reading.</p>
