         <h2>Summary</h2>   
            <p>I am an experienced lab technician looking to develop my coding skills. I was first introduced to coding when modelling physics problems using MATLAB at university and found 
                it to be both challenging and enjoyable. After working in a lab setting for several years I would like to branch out and build upon my previous coding experience.
            </p>
